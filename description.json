First person to send me a legit screenshot of the giant duck AND the treasure chest in THE SAME IMAGE will forever have their username inscribed in the waterfall cave. (first to leave a comment on here anyways)\n\nIt's a whole new game, good luck :)\n\nWorks in multiplayer as well, bit buggy though, put bugs on the github.\n\n[MODDERS] If you fork the mod, make sure to change the mod id. And add something cool don't just re-upload it. https://github.com/Woukie/Scrapfarer\n\nRussian translation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2LaVuvCj-I\n\nThis is my last mod.",
