   "description" : "[h1]Scrapfarer[/h1]\n\nGet to the end and find the treasure! Most testers never got close, so if anyone legitimately finishes the game I commend you.\n\nIt's a whole new game, good luck :)\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h2]Features[/h2]\n[list]\n    [*]8 stages\n    [*]New parts\n    [*]New gameplay loop\n    [*]25 blocks\n    [*]Hours of suffering\n    [*]Ducks and doughnuts\n[/list] \n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h2]Other[/h2]\nHad to rush the release a bit because I want to work on other things, but it's playable. Also works in multiplayer, bit buggy, put bugs on the [url=https://github.com/Woukie/Scrapfarer]GitHub[/url].\n\n[b][MODDERS][/b] If you fork the mod, make sure to change the mod id. And add something cool don't be lame and just re-upload it.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h2]Known Bugs[/h2]\n[h3]Duplicate builds[/h3]\nSometimes re-spawning loads two identical boats, one liftable, one not. To fix, go to the red computer and [b]revert to last save[/b]\n\n[h3]Damage when another player joins[/h3]\nThis one's on the chopping block. To resolve, just [b]jump into the water and die[/b].\n\n[h3]No build/floor when joining[/h3]\nWhen joining a world, sometimes there's no floor below the player, which causes the player to continually respawn and die. To resolve, [b]type /start, then /stop in chat[/b].\n\n[h3]Flying boats[/h3]\nIf a boat was on the lift when you started a run, it will be loaded as a static creation when re-spawning, I cannot fix this. To resolve, [b]add+break a block on the build[/b] and make sure to take builds off the lift before starting a run.\n\nAlso, frequently save builds to the lift if you like them in case anything happens to them in game!\n\n[h3]Switching plots on re-join[/h3]\nThis is intentional, and is a result of how plots are registered\n\n[h3]Invisible second character[/h3]\nSymptoms\n[list]\n    [*]Random damage\n    [*]Randomly unlock shop items\n    [*]Continuous dying\n    [*]Other players see another nametag\n[/list] \n\nTo resolve, reloading the world may help, but I can't reliably recreate the bug to even begin patching this. \n\nThis is one of those bugs where, no ",
