Most testers never got close, so if anyone legitimately finishes the game I commend you.\n\nIt's a whole new game, good luck :)\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h2]Features[/h2]\n[list]\n    [*]8 stages\n    [*]New parts\n    [*]New gameplay loop\n    [*]25 blocks\n    [*]Hours of suffering\n[/list] \n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h2]Other[/h2]\nHad to rush the release a bit because I want to work on other things, but it's playable. Also works in multiplayer, bit buggy, put bugs on the [url=https://github.com/Woukie/Scrapfarer]GitHub[/url].\n\n[b][MODDERS][/b] If you fork the mod, make sure to change the mod id. And add something cool don't be lame and just re-upload it.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nThis is probably going to be my last mod, I'll accept pull requests if they're good.",
