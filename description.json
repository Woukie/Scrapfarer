Also works in multiplayer, bit buggy, put bugs on the [url=https://github.com/Woukie/Scrapfarer]GitHub[/url].\r\n\r\n[b][MODDERS][/b] If you fork the mod, make sure to change the mod id. And add something cool don't be lame and just re-upload it.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n\r\nThis is probably going to be my last mod, though I'll still do some minor fixes and accept pull requests if they're good.",
