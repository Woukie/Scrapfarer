## Hello modders!

I don't plan on adding any more content myself, but I accept pull requests if anyone gets inspired

- Only upload your own code (base game code is also acceptable)
- Keep it balanced
- All bug fixes are welcomed!

### Ideas

Straight from my 'future features' todo list

- Timer for all runs after the first (bonus if you list the times for each stage as they are completed, look at speedrunner streams for what I'm talking about)
- Turn the logbook into a menu that can start/stop runs and open the monitor UIs. Must be same style as other UIs
- Effects (there are ~28 damage and hit effects in `Effects/Database/EffectSets/obstacles.effectset` that need changing, just diddn't get round to it for release)
- If some big head village savant can add part mod support that would be so awesome (as in, another mod maker could add shop items. Maybe have them include a json file in their mod that specifies unlock area positions/sizes, cost etc...)
- More priate mission rewards
- Better water shader
- Better skybox
- Visualise coins earned in-game
- Bug fixes
- Friction balance (I don't think this is needed at all)
- Sounds
- More obstacles
- Localization (good luck! Images are going to be hard to translate. IBM VGA 8x14 regular with pablodraw)
- More shop unlocks
- Map reworks
- Map secrets / puzzles
